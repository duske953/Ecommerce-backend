## Tech-freak: Server for Tech-Freak E-Commerce Web App

**1. Project Description:**

This repository serves as the backend for the Tech Freak e-commerce web application. It handles functionalities like:

* User authentication and management (signup, login, password reset)
* Product data management (CRUD operations)
* Order processing
* Email notifications

**2. Technologies:**

* **Node.js:** [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en) - Open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side and networking applications.
* **Express.js:** [https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/) - A popular web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
* **MongoDB:** [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL document database that offers flexible data storage and retrieval capabilities.
* **Mongoose:** [https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/) - An object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB in Node.js, providing a convenient way to interact with the database using JavaScript objects.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token):** [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) - An open standard (RFC 7519) for representing claims secured by cryptographic signatures. Used for secure information transmission between parties, often in the context of authentication and authorization.
* **Nodemailer:** [https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) - A popular Node.js library for sending emails.
* **Stripe:** [https://stripe.com/](https://stripe.com/) - A payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept online payments.

**3. Security Features:**

* **Rate limiting:** Implemented to prevent malicious overuse of the API and protect against denial-of-service attacks.
* **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) handling:** Ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
* **Robust error handling:** Provides informative error messages for troubleshooting and prevents unexpected application crashes.
* **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection:** Mitigates the risk of unauthorized actions being performed on a user's account by an attacker.

**4. Frontend:**
